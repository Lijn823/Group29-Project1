**Please note that Lijn823 and Jianing Li are the same person.** The difference was caused because After Jianing Li's initial commit of the data cleaning code, she reconfigured Git's user.email in the terminal. This correctly linked her commit to the GitHub account Lijn823 through the email address, causing GitHub to prioritize displaying her GitHub username.

**For similar reason, 888JackJiang and Jack88-lab are accounts belonging to the same person.** After modifying the README.md, Jack Jiang switched to a different account to participate in the group collaboration because his Git user.email was linked to another one of his GitHub accounts.
